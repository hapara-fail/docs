The modern classroom has become a laboratory for mass surveillance. We are a collective of students, developers, and privacy advocates dedicated to exposing this reality, explaining the technology, and empowering a generation to reclaim their digital autonomy.

## The Always-On Eye

Marketed with reassuring words like "safety" and "focus," companies like Hapara, GoGuardian, and Gaggle have built a billion-dollar industry on widespread, nonstop, and forced monitoring of students. Here's a closer look at the reality.

### The 24/7 Digital Leash

GoGuardian and Hapara give administrators a god-view of student activity. This isn't just about a teacher seeing your screen during class. It's about your school account becoming a tether. At home, on weekends, any device logged into that account is subject to monitoring. This constant observation creates a strong "chilling effect"—it makes students afraid to look up sensitive political or personal topics for fear of being flagged by an unseen watcher.

### Automated Flagging Systems

Gaggle's AI is a prime example of flawed "threat detection." It automatically scans the private contents of your emails, chats, and documents for keywords. It can't understand sarcasm, context, or the nuance of creative writing. A student writing a fictional story, researching a historical conflict, or even using slang can be automatically flagged. This can trigger a chain of events leading to disciplinary action or even contact with law enforcement, all from a machine's error.

### The Student Data Goldmine

You are more than a student; you are a data point. Every click, every search, every word typed is collected, aggregated, and analyzed. This creates incredibly detailed behavioral profiles on minors without their informed consent. These profiles are a valuable commodity, and the long-term consequences—from targeted advertising to predictive "risk" scores that could follow you to college or employment—are largely unknown and unregulated.

### Blocking Learning, Not Threats

Under the guise of keeping students on-task, these platforms use aggressive web filters. They frequently block access to legitimate educational content, from GitHub repositories for coding students to news articles and academic papers on subjects like civics, history, or health. This digital censorship actively gets in the way of research and learning, creating a walled-off internet that poorly prepares students for the real world.

## Know Your Monitor

These companies present themselves as helpful partners in education. But a closer look at their features and real-world impact tells a different story.

### GoGuardian

GoGuardian offers peace of mind with powerful filtering and classroom management tools. Teachers can easily guide learning, minimize distractions, and create a safe digital environment for every student, ensuring they stay focused and protected.

### Gaggle

Using advanced AI, Gaggle proactively assists schools in preventing bullying, self-harm, and violence. By scanning student communications on school-provided accounts, it helps ensure a positive, safe culture where every child can thrive without fear.

### Hapara

Hapara's "Highlights" feature makes visible learning a reality. Teachers can view student screens in real-time, share helpful links directly to their browsers, and ensure the entire class is on the right track with just a glance, fostering a collaborative and efficient classroom.

## Our Philosophy

### 01. Empowerment Through Understanding

Surveillance systems are powerful because they are treated like confusing "black boxes." Our first mission is to break that box open. We provide not just tools to shield you, but clear explanations that turn you from a passive subject into an informed actor. Understanding how your data is tracked is the most crucial step toward meaningful resistance.

### 02. Privacy is the Foundation of Education

A mind under surveillance cannot be free. True learning—which involves questioning things, making mistakes, and thinking differently—requires the psychological safety that only privacy can provide. By normalizing constant monitoring, schools are teaching a whole generation to accept a surveillance society as normal. We reject this. We believe privacy isn't an optional extra; it is essential for personal growth.

### 03. Building a Movement, Not Just a Website

This is a call to action. Our tools are open-source, our research is public, and our community is our greatest strength. We are building a movement of students, privacy advocates, and educators. Your contribution—whether it's code, new information, or simply spreading the word—strengthens our collective fight for a future where technology serves education, not control.

## Our Pledge

To earn your trust, we hold ourselves to the highest standards. We are committed to the following principles in everything we do:

- **No Tracking. Ever.** This website and our services will never use analytics, tracking cookies, or log your personal information. Your privacy is the mission, not a product to be sold.
- **Always Open Source.** All of our tools, research, and code are publicly available on GitHub. We believe in transparency and the power of the community to build stronger, more trustworthy solutions.
- **Community-Driven Intelligence.** Our blocklists and tools are continuously improved by submissions and feedback from students like you. We are a living project that adapts to the ever-changing landscape of edtech surveillance.
